Please note, there are only a few developers working on WebToEpub, and we're not paid for doing this.  (WebToEpub is completely free, and generates no money.) By asking to add a site, you're asking us to give you some of our limited free time. So, we think it's not unreasonable for me to ask you to do as much as you can to help us.

### Check the site has not already been requested.
You can search the issues to see if any have the site name by putting the site name in the search box near the top of the screen.  See https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests.
If there is an existing issue, you can add a comment to the issue to indicate you're also interested in the site.

### Provide URL for web page that contains Table of Contents (list of chapters) of a typical story on the site

### Did you try using the Default Parser for the site?  If not, why not?
Instructions for using the default parser can be found at https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub/wiki/FAQ#how-to-convert-a-new-site-using-the-default-parser

### What settings did you use?  What didn't work?
* URL of first chapter
* CSS selector for element holding content to put into EPUB
* CSS selector for element holding Title of Chapter
* CSS selector for element(s) to remove

### If the Default Parser did not work, if you have developer skills, did you try writing a new parser?
Instructions https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub/wiki/FAQ#how-to-write-a-new-parser

### If you don't have developer skills, can you ask a friend who does have them if they can do it for you?

### If you tried writing a parser, and it doesn't work.  Attach the parser here.
