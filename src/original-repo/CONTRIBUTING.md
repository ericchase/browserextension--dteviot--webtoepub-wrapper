## Pull Request Check List
* Do all existing unit tests pass?  (FYI, I find it easier to get the unit tests to run under Firefox, instead of Chrome.)
* Have all warnings and errors reported by eslint been fixed?
* If you've added new behavior, 
    * Can a user turn it off?  
    * Is it off by default?  Note, users don't like it when behavior changes without warning.
* Have you updated the "contributors" section of packages.json with your name? (and ideally email, so I can contact you easily.)
* Have you updated the "Credits" section of readme.md with your name?
* Are you committing to the ExperimentalTab branch?
* Have you rebased your commit?
